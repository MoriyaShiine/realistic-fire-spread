-You do not provide a crash report or log if the game crashed.
-Your issue has to do with using the wrong version of or not having a dependency. The fabric loader tells you exactly what you need to do.
-You are using an outdated version of the mod, do not provide the version of the mod you are using, or are using "latest." "Latest" doesn't mean anything to developers, so please avoid using the term and state the specific version, even if it does happen to be the latest release at the time.
